# Prepare ANTLR4 on your machine (optional)
ANTLR is a parser generating library. You write in a language defined by ANTLR4, compile that with the ANTLR4 compiler and get classes for C#, javascript etc. These classes then can parse your text so that you receive objects to work with.

ANTLR.g file -> compile manually by calling antlr compiler in cmd or pre-build -> use classes in code

[See these instructions to setup your machine for using ANTLR4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/master/runtime/CSharp)
